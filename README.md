## Summary

I have a solid background in modern C++, parallel computing including GPUs, computer science and applied mathematics. My professional life has been so far connected to academia and developing research software. I am currently a core developer of large-scale Particle-in-Cell code [PIConGPU](https://github.com/ComputationalRadiationPhysics/picongpu), soon to [run on the first exascale supercomputer Frontier](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/caar/frontier-caar/). I also contribute to parallel programming libraries [alpaka](https://github.com/alpaka-group/alpaka) and [cupla](https://github.com/alpaka-group/cupla). I also have a university teaching experience prior to switching to a fully research position.

## Accomplishments

- **Best paper award at Russian Supercomputing days**
- **Presidential scholarship for outstanding young scientists**  _(2016 - 2017)_
- **Presidential scholarship for outstanding students**

## Languages

- **English**: Advanced, ≈ C1
- **Russian**: Native
- **German**: Beginner, ≈ A1

## Education

- **PhD in Theoretical Computer Science** (Russian candidate of science)<br>
[University of Nizhni Novgorod](http://eng.unn.ru/) - Nizhni Novgorod, Russia _(Sep 2012 - Oct 2016)_
  - Due to the way PhD studies are typically (under)financed in Russia, it was done in parallel to the jobs described above
  - My PhD studies dealt with polyhedral computation in general dimension case, namely with incremental algorithms for vertex and facet enumeration to compute dual description of convex polyhedra.
  - Developed a new modification of the double description method combining it with some features of the Quickhull algorithm and obtained complexity bounds for the new algorithm.
  - Proposed an algorithmical improvement to Fourier-Motzkin elimination - a faster way of checking conditions for Chernikov rules / Imbert's acceleration theorems.
  - For a related problem of incrementally removing vertices/constraints considered a special case and proposed a new algorithm based on reverting iterations of the double description method and proved its polynomiality for this case.
