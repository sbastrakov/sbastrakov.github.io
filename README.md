Researcher and C++ developer, working on advanced software for large scale plasma simulation for 10+ years.
Currently a core developer and maintainer of particle-in-cell code [PIConGPU](https://github.com/ComputationalRadiationPhysics/picongpu) preparing it to [run on world's first exascale supercomputer](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/caar/frontier-caar/).
Very experienced in modern C++ and parallel computing including GPUs, with a solid background in math and computer science.

My professional life has so far been connected to academia and scientific computing, however mostly towards the software side.
I would self-describe the nature of my work for last 6 years as a research software engineer, though not by job title.
Now I am planning to switch to industry and looking for a job as a senior software developer or a position combining software development and research.
Open to move within Germany, would like to start in Q4 2022.
Most of my recent work is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/sbastrakov/), and a detailed job and education record is presented below.

  - Was done in parallel to the jobs described above (as typical for PhD studies in Russia)
  - My PhD studies dealt with polyhedral computation in general dimension case, namely with incremental algorithms for vertex and facet enumeration to compute dual description of convex polyhedra.
  - Developed a new modification of the double description method combining it with some features of the Quickhull algorithm and obtained complexity bounds for the new algorithm.
  - Proposed an algorithmical improvement to Fourier-Motzkin elimination - a faster way of checking conditions for Chernikov rules / Imbert's acceleration theorems.
  - For a related problem of incrementally removing vertices/constraints considered a special case and proposed a new algorithm based on reverting iterations of the double description method and proved its polynomiality for this case.
